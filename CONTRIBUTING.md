# Guide to Contributing to "What's for Dinner"
Thank you for your interest in contributing to "What's for Dinner"! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels and backgrounds.

## Team Norms
Our team is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We value open communication, collaboration, and respect for all team members. We encourage all team members to contribute to the project in a constructive and positive manner. Here are some specefics:

### Team values

Important agreements so that everyone knows what is expected of them in terms of responsibility.

- The team will communicate via Discord.
- All tasks will be visable on Github
- Members who need help can ask for it on Discord or speak with the professor. 
- Conflict Resolution Guide:
  - If there is a disagreement with two people, both members can voice their problems to the rest of the team and another member will work to solve it. 
  - If a member is failing to deliver their obligations, there will be an internal discussion first by the rest of the team and if the problem persits later, the member will be reported to the professor. 
- Members are expected to check the Discord Channel regularly and should respond within 48 hours.
  - A response can include either a written message or a "thumbs up", just make sure to say something.
  - Be sure to @ specefic members if you need their attention promptly. 

### Sprint cadence

- Our sprints will last 2 weeks

### Daily standups

- Standups will occur every Monday/Wednesdays directly after class.
- Everyone is expected to be present synchronously.
- Members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
- Member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be spoken to internally by others in the group. 
  - If the member is continually failing to miss/make no progress during standups, they will be reported to the professor. 

### Coding standards

- All members will use Visual Studio Code.
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve.
  - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).
